# LAST STAND

This is an old version of LAST STAND written as a school project

A simple RTS game where you must defend your base against hordes of incoming monsters.
Because of tight deadline, many things are unpolished and unfinished. Game also has problems
when playing in normal terminal, instead of Intellij.

Despite this, I am still proud, since this is one of my first bigger projects and it still came out nicely :p
